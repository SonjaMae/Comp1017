					<h3>What Is Honey?</h3>
					<p>A single cell of honeycomb is filled with the concentrated nectar of thousands of flowers, the healthiest and rawest form of honey available. A delicacy of nature straight from the source, our Raw Honeycomb is hand-cut from the frame and boxed, with no additional treatment or processing. Honeycomb paired with cheeses, fruit, and edible flowers is a gorgeous and delicious spread for guests. Honeycomb is 100% edible. KSA Kosher Certified.</p>
					<p>Raw Honeycomb squares are now available in two sizes! Our original Raw Honeycomb Square is 10oz. and its little brother the Honeycomb Mini weighs in at 4.5oz.Both sizes are the very same raw Georgia Wildflower Honeycomb. Raw honeycomb is a gluten-free product.</p>
