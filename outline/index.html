					<h4>About the Experience</h4>
					<p>The homey atmosphere creates a soothing environment which sets you at ease at once. We are a smaller one room studio, which means smaller class sizes and more hands on instruction, with personal interaction.</p>
				</aside>
				<aside>
					<h4>Etiquette Guidelines</h4>
					<p>The yoga room is silent before, during and after class.  During the class, the instructor is the only one speaking. There are some general etiquette guidelines to follow in the studio:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>With respect to those sensitive to fragrances we ask that you refrain from wearing strong scents.  We also refrain from burning incense.</li>
						<li>We ask you to be mindful of others at the studio if you plan on attending class please be on time to respect the sacred place of others.</li>
						<li>The instruction is verbal and very technical with no demonstrations. It is very important that you are actively listening to the instructor throughout class and allow others the same courtesy.</li>
						<li>There are no shoes in the studio. Please be aware that you’ll be barefoot in the yoga room—any contagious foot conditions should be treated as soon as possible or covered/dressed while walking through the studio.</li>
						<li>Please bring only your mat, towel and water into the room. Do not bring purses, wallets, phones or other distractions. Due to the heat and humidity in the room, these types of items could be damaged and may pose as a distraction.</li>

				<h3>Spring Yin Workshop</h3>
				<article>
					<h4>Why Sign Up?</h4>
					<p>It happens every spring. This year’s Spring Yin Workshop will be with Tori Lunden on Saturday, May 28, 2016 from 2:15pm - 4:15pm. After the joy and jubilation of being able to play outside comes the aches and pains in areas we forgot we had. It comes as a bit of a shock to our bodies this shift to suddenly gardening, biking, running, hiking, along with all the other outdoor activities we love. Even for those that stay active through the winter; the spring is often accompanied by stiff muscles and creaky joints.</p>
				</article>
				<aside>
					<h4>Information</h4>
					<p>This extended practice will help our bodies through this rocky transition with a combination of gentle movement and passive, supported stretches for the shoulders, back, and hips. Take two hours to relax and restore so you can get on with enjoying our beautiful Edmonton summer.</p>
					<p>This practice is suitable for beginners, experienced students, and especially beneficial for those with active lifestyles. The cost will be $30 (includes GST). Please register in advance at http://www.shantillyyogastudio.ca/events or call 780-421-9444</p>
					<p>Tori's classes are always a fun and eclectic environment. She delights in teaching people who, like her, never thought yoga was something they could do let alone enjoy. Tori has a degree in social work from the University of Calgary and has been teaching yoga since 2008; when she would never again work anywhere that required her to sit for eight hours a day.</p>

				<p>Yin, Restorative Yoga, Yoga for Backs will be the classes for you. Gentle movements, using props to support and nurture you at a slower pace to calm your mind and body.  Students can relieve the tension and stresses of daily lives as well as working without the pressure of working beyond their comfort level.

				<h3>Flow Classes</h3>
				<p>The flow classes continuously move your body integrating strength and flexibility in a non-stop shift from posture to posture.  The flow classes vary from slower basic movements to progressively more advanced.
